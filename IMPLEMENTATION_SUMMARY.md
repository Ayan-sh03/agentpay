- ⏳ Comprehensive request validation
- ⏳ Advanced encryption mechanisms
- ⏳ Security testing suite

### Policy Engine
- ⏳ Complete OPA policies for business rules
- ⏳ Dynamic policy loading and updating
- ⏳ Policy decision explanation features

### Performance & Scalability
- ⏳ Complete rate limiting implementation with Redis
- ⏳ Performance testing framework
- ⏳ Database optimization and connection pooling

### Production Hardening
- ⏳ Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- ⏳ Health checks and monitoring endpoints
- ⏳ Backup and disaster recovery procedures
